    comment: If you're looking for something really cheap, camping is always a great option.  Warrior's Path is the most visited state park in Tennessee, and for good reason.  The campground is up on the ridge of a peninsula surrounded by a lake.  Their bathrooms are clean and well-maintained.  Caleb used to run around the campground all the time for cross-country practice.  If you're traveling here in an RV or camper, we recommend you stay here.  Make sure to book ahead of time, though, because October is our "busy season".
